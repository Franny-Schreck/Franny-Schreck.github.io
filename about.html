    <p data-aos="fade-up" style="text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">
      Given that you've come this far, you already know a lot about me! I like travelling, sightseeing, visiting museums and sampling the local cuisine; to learn and experience new things, improve on my existing skills or find something that is completely different to anything I've done before. This is part of the reason I'm teaching myself Greek at the moment - although I also just like the sound of the language and am intruiged by its millenia-spanning history.<br>
      
      Currently, I'm working my way through the list of <a href="https://1001bookreviews.com/the-1001-book-list/">1001 Books You Must Read Before You Die</a> by Peter Boxall, since I love to read and want to make sure I don't miss anything through the vast array of possible picks.

            In my free time I like to do different kinds of sports, such as kickboxing, field hockey, archery, bouldering, and tennis. But if the weather doesn't play along I don't mind staying indoors and working on my piano and drums skills. I'm currently in the process of acquiring my <a href="https://www.blasmusikjugend.at/musik/leistungsabzeichen/">musical proficiency badge</a> for the drum set, for which I get to be part of an ensemble, learn to play the marimba and djembe, and study multiple solos.<br>
            
            Because of the nationwide Covid-19 lockdowns, I spent a lot of time in front of the computer, so I decided to pick up coding as an additional skill. This website is the result of my dabbling in webdesign, and most of my written work at University is now done in the LaTeX typesetting system, in which I have also created my own tools for handling citations and bibliographies, since existing solutions did not work for me because of my requirements as a major in humanities. I also finished the online course <a href="https://cs50.harvard.edu/x/2023/">CS50: Introduction to Computer Science</a> provided by Harvard, which taught me the most important data structures and how to implement them in various projects, which were built using different programming languages, such as C, Python, SQL, HTML, CSS and JavaScript. Now, I aim to further my understanding by working through Bjarne Stroustrup's <a href="https://www.stroustrup.com/programming.html">Programming: Principles and Practice Using C++</a> to improve my programming skills.
