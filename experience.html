    <h2 data-aos="fade-up">Work Experience</h2>
    <p data-aos="fade-up" style="text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">
      Since 2017, I've regularly done holiday internships - which tought me valuable lessons about the realities of being part of a bigger workforce. During my pursuit of my bachelor's degree in History I also worked some jobs on a part-time basis, including an auxiliary teaching position at an IB school and customer service. For a detailed listing, see below!

          My educational journey started in the Gymnasium (grammar school) in the countryside, where I would go until I finished the Unterstufe (graduate level). But after spending a gap year in an english 'Waldorf' school, I switched to an International Baccalaureate school in Vienna. I am very glad I made this decision because it allowed me to experience an approach to the subjects taught and relationships with the teachers that I had not come across thus far. <br>

          Following a series of summer-jobs in administrative office environments and seasonal waiting in restaurants, I was able to pursue something that I felt to be more impactful: helping to teach students and encouraging them to fulfill their potential as an auxiliary teacher. <br>

          I am looking forward to working in both academic research positions in the course of my master's degree in History as well as those which my new paths that my current pursuit in Environmental Engineering will bring!

          I've always been interested in the complex interactions of environemntal science and engineering, so that I had already enrolled in a few courses about this during my history bachelor - so I feel very excited to be able to be studying this!

          Here, I mostly interacted directly with custormers through one of the many Wien Ticket booths, although I also helped out at the backend, answering more complex queries via e-mail as well as working with the accounting team.

          I got my degree in 2023, with a grade point average of 1.28 and thus passed with distinction. The pursuit of this degree tought me many valuable lessons, including the importance of asking interesting questions in a way that tentative answers can be gained through thorough research, balanced argumentation, and good presentation.

          Here my main job was of an administrative nature, organising files on a computer and sorting paperwork. This enabled me to aquire basic Microsoft Excel and Word skills, and making me grateful for the ECDL-licence I obtained while in school.

          This was my first 'real' job, and the fast-paced environment was certainly something to get used to. But through keeping up with the customers' wishes and demands as well as helping out in the kitchen after my shift I gained still-valuable experiences.
