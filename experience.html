    <h2 class="faded"> Work Experience </h2>
    <p class="faded" style="text-align: center; font-size: 15px;">
      Since 2017, I've regularly done holiday internships - from which I have learned valuable lessons about working as part of teams of different sizes, backgrounds and motivations. Alongside working on my bachelor's degree in history I also took some jobs on a part-time basis, including an auxiliary teaching position at an IB school and customer service. For further details, read on!

            My educational journey started in a Gymnasium (grammar school) in the Austrian countryside, which I attended until I finished the Unterstufe (graduate level). After spending a gap year in a 'Waldorf' school in England, I switched to an International Baccalaureate school in Vienna. I am very glad I made this decision because it allowed me to experience an approach to the subjects taught and relationships with the teachers that I had not come across thus far. <br>

            Following a series of summer jobs in administrative office environments and seasonal waiting in restaurants, I was able to pursue something that I felt to be more impactful: helping to teach students and encouraging them to fulfill their potential as an auxiliary teacher. <br>

            I am looking forward to working in academic research positions in the course of my master's degree in history as well as any that will emerge from my current pursuit of Environmental Engineering!

          I've always been interested in the complex interactions of environmental science and engineering, so that I had already enrolled in a few courses about this during my history bachelor. I am very excited to be studying this!

          Here, I mostly interacted directly with custormers through one of the many Wien Ticket booths, although I also helped out in office positions, answering more complex queries via e-mail and working with the accounting team.

          I got my degree in 2023, with a grade point average of 1.28 and thus passed with distinction. The pursuit of this degree taught me many valuable lessons, including the importance of asking interesting questions in a way that tentative answers can be gained through thorough research, balanced argumentation, and good presentation.

          This was my first 'real' job, and the fast-paced environment was certainly something to get used to. But through keeping up with the customers' wishes and demands as well as helping out in the kitchen after my shift I gained experiences that are still valuable to me today.
