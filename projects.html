    <h1 class="faded" style="color: #e9a617;"> My Projects! </h1>
    <p class="faded" style="text-align: center; font-size: 15px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
      Most of these projects are the results of university courses, but some started as independent research sessions that turned into full-fledged papers. Global history (researching the interconnectedness and developments that have created what we now think of as inevitable present) and contemporary history (relatively recent events and their place / role in the collective memory of nations)  are absolutely fascinating areas of research to me and are thus generally where my focus lies. Recently I have also started to appreciate the intricacies of the Middle Ages - and most notably the Italian Renaissance - which is why one of my bachelor's theses revolved around this very topic.
    <br>
      Since starting my degree in enviromental engineering I've also created many projects centered around quantitative analysis and coding using real-world data. Since some of these projects were team-efforts, I have indicated this in the description - since I can't take full credit for them.

        <h3> Applied Remote Sensing </h3>
        <p>
          In this two-part project, I worked with a fellow student to analyse data from the Sentinel satellites using Python. First, an appropriate area was searched for, processed and classified according to its vegetation, using different classifiers trained with a set of manually sorted data. Secondly, the tempoal change in snow cover in a selected alpine area was determined and its snow melt analysed. For this, spectral band data from Sentinel-2 (to calculate spectral indices) and the radar data from Sentinel-1 (to determine backscatter) were used.

        <p>
          A subsurface was analyised using various geophysical methods, including Vertical Electrical Sounding, Electrical Resistivity Tomography, Transient Electromagnetic Methods, and Seismic Refraction Tomography. The goal being to identify aquifer geometry, areas of inhomogenous groundwater flow and the location for installing a groundwater well. This project was created with two fellow students and involved Python scripts for each method, and thorough understanding of the resulting data to allow for an adequate analysis.

        <h3> Palazzos, Patronage and Power </h3>
        <p>
          There are many myths surrounding the Italian Renaissance: the city states of this period are said to have been unrivalled in their cultural significance as well as their political skills. Even if this image has been relativised by more recent research, the fascination emanating from this epoch remains unbroken.

        <h3> Quantifying Urban Gender Bias </h3>
        <p>
          The act of naming city streets goes beyond simple labeling. It can be described as a performative act that shapes a contested space of public discourse, since street names are not neutral; they tell stories, reflect power dynamics, and reveal the intentions of those who named them. Therefore, an analysis of honorific streets in Vienna was conducted. Using Python, RegEx, OpenStreetMap data, and the Wikidata API this project shows how the naming of streets reflects the struggle for symbolic space - and how far it has come.

        <h3> Energy Systems and Climate Change </h3>
        <p>
          This was a three-part project with two other members, in which we analysed energy systems in terms of greenhouse gas emissions (and their possible reduction). For this, we analysed energy-economic aspects of climate change in practical exercises, including calculating emissions, carbon budgets and different carbon allocation methods, as well as climate action simulations and projections for emissions reductions through tax and certificate trading for selected countries.

          My research project for the course on Music Information Retrieval and Sound Analysis in Python was an evaluation of the Librosa python package&#39s beat tracking function. I utilised signal processing with a focus on digital audio, and data visualization techniques. Through this activity I furthered my knowledge of different data structures and debugging techniques as well as open software principles.

        <h3> Carbon Capture and Storage </h3>
        <p>
          Carbon capture and storage is a process in which fossil CO<sub>2</sub> emissions are captured from the atmosphere and transported and stored in special underground storage sites, preventing them from further engaging in the Greenhouse effect. This potential panacea is at the center of current climate discussions. Considering questions of economic viability, storage sites, efficiency, and conflicts of interest this project provides an insight into the questionable future-proofness of this technology.

          In this work, the significance of Venetian diplomatic practice is relativised by putting it into the necessary historical and political contexts of late medieval and early modern methods of foreign relations. Within this complex network of volatile relations within the Appenine Peninsula, as well as with the powers of Europe and in the Levante, information-gathering and peace-keeping was of utmost importance and facilitated through intricate systems of communication.

            In this work, a very specific form of gender-based violence was analyzed: the topic of systematic rape of women in times of war, which is still often neglected in research. In this work I tried to shed light on the cultural and colonial backgrounds of the Korean Comfort Women system emposed by the Japanese during World War II in order to understand the structure and justification of it.

          As a general rule, some events and perspectives receive more attention than others - this, however, can be detrimental to historiography. That is what I tried to show in this work, in which one of the most central and intensely investigated events of the 20th century is processed with the help of an unconventional source: Germany after Hitler came to power and the Holocaust using an intimate 'queer' notebook.

        <h3> History of Human Rights </h3>
        <p>
          Contrary to the belief that human rights are self-evident or even naturally given, the historical changeability and the wide scope for interpretation are indeed central to this phenomenon. The contemporary understanding of human rights is based on experiences of oppression; moral authority and insistence on universal validity are, after all, not based on declarative, abstract, and philosophical explanations, but on the practical promise of averting avoidable suffering and guaranteeing individual freedom.

        <p>
          My works in this topic explore the transformation of social life in the post-Roman world of the Mediterranean and surrounding regions from the fifth through to the eighth centuries. The political and social changes of this period had a lasting effect on the broad variety of social networks that defined the lives of individuals. These changes can be seen in the dominant social media of the time: letters, art, poetry, sermons, inscriptions, to name just a few.

        <h3> Rome after Rome </h3>
        <p>
          Rome was once the capital of a Mediterranean empire, one of the largest cities of the ancient world, with around a million inhabitants. But during the Middle Ages, Rome was a city of only tens of thousands. Yet it was home to one of medieval Europe&#39s most important institutions: the papacy - and so its classical and Christian glories endured. It  thus also continued to be an important center of political, religious, and economic innovation, and a goal for pilgrims, emperors, and different factions.

          There are different kinds of stresses: eustress can contribute to special performance and concentration abilities while distress can lead to a long-term decline in performance and lack of attention. Esp&shy;ecially acoustic stress is associated with negative stress. But what impact does this stress have on our creativity in the short term? In this online study, the stress level is increased through enervating music to test for an effect on the creativity of the participants by means of a modified creativity test.

          Here, an overview of the history of political thought from antiquity to modern times was created. Political theory is treated and contextualized from a historical perspective in its diachronic development. The project follows both a chronological and a thematic approach for the discussion of its development and evolution. Special attention was given to political thought in Ancient Greece, in the Islamic World, in Western modernity, and in the context of economics.

          The exhibition space conceptualised in this work gives visitors an understanding of the connection between the topics of sport and gender through six large installations and three text elements. The questions "What does sport have to do with gender?" and "What role do/did women play in the history of sports in Austria?" serve as a guiding thread and  different approaches to answering them are examined through multi-sensory and interactive expositions.

        <h3> Feminist Theories </h3>
        <p>
          Historical gender research deals with gendered people and understands 'gender' as an indispensable category for the historical analysis of human relationships. Many influential feminists of the 1970s argue that inequality is not based on gender differences, but on power relationships, whereas today another view prevails. Under the title gender, nothing other than women's history was often practiced and thus the demand to recognize 'women' and 'men' as discursive constructions, to deconstruct them and to understand gender as a metaphor for power relations, was not met.

        <h3> Tokyo Trials </h3>
        <p>
          The Allied war-crime courts in Asia and Europe were set up with the intention of bringing to justice those who had committed atrocities against military personnel and civilians. This task turned out to involve a complex network of rules and intentions, further complicated by the fact that economic, cultural and political realities of the invaded regions had a significant role. In this work I wanted to highlight and explain the context in which the British war crimes trials were performed, using the trials in Burma as a paradigmatic example.

        <h3> Economic History </h3>
        <p>
          Today the capitalist economy is an integral part of human coexistence, and difficult to question - on the one hand because of its ubiquitous presence and on the other because of its inherent contradictions. The question of what the economy actually is, or what constitutes it, was analysed in this work. Significant texts by (economic) historians were consulted with regard to the character of economies, the connections between politics, society and the economy, and capitalism per se.

        <h3> Colonialism and Science </h3>
        <p>
          Many sciences - from law to medicine, from philology to pharmacy - have made their contribution to the construction of colonialism. Some disciplines, such as economic anthropology or comparative law, only emerged at all when the colonial bureaucracies were confronted with foreign understandings of economics and law and sought to remedy this situation. It is only in the last few decades that the knowledge of the Global South, which has been suppressed and in part lost in the process, has been studied more closely.

        <h3> Global History </h3>
        <p>
          A quote by Theodore H. Von Laue served as a springboard into further studies into various countries' histories, including China, Brazil, America and India (amongst others): “World history poses perhaps the biggest challenge for the present generation of academic historians. There is no dearth of available facts. What we need are proper (panhuman!) perspectives and an enlarged vision for organizing these facts in order to gain a clearer understanding of where we all have come from over human destiny."

        <h3> Material History </h3>
        <p>
          The aim of this historical enquiry is to educate people about materials. This can be achieved through a historical narrative in which, on the one hand, technical, religious, political, economic and cultural contexts of action and effect are shown and, on the other, the material is assigned its own 'active potential'. A central question is how conclusions can be drawn about collective identities or power relations. Some materials function as cultural symbols, their use being inherently context-dependent, even on a political level.
