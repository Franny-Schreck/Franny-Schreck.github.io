        <h3> Music Information Retrieval </h3>
        <p>
          My research project for the course on Music Information Retrieval and Sound Analysis in Python was an evaluation of the Librosa python package&#39s beat tracking function. There, I utilised signal processing with a focus on digital audio, and data visualization techniques. Through this activity I furthered my knowledge of different data structures and debugging techniques and open software principles.

        <h3> Colonialism and Science </h3>
        <p>
          Many sciences - from law to medicine, from philology to pharmacy - have made their contribution to the construction of colonialism. Some disciplines, such as economic anthropology or comparative law, only emerged at all when the colonial bureaucracies were confronted with foreign understandings of economics and law and sought to remedy this situation. It is only in the last few decades that the knowledge of the Global South, which has been suppressed and in part lost in the process, has been studied more closely.

          <h3> Comfort Women </h3>
          <p>
            In this work, a very specific form of gender-based violence was analyzed: the topic of systematic rape of women in times of war, which is still often neglected in research. In this work I tried to shed light on the cultural and colonial backgrounds of the Korean Comfort Women system emposed by the Japanese during World War II in order to understand the structure and justification of it.

        <h3> Homosexuality in Nazi Germany </h3>

          As a general rule, some events and perspectives receive more attention than others - which, however, can be detrimental to historiography. This is what I tried to show in this work, in which one of the most central and intensely investigated events of the 20th century is processed with the help of an unconventional source: Germany after Hitler came to power and the Holocaust using an intimate 'queer' notebook.

        <h3> History of Human Rights </h3>
        <p>
          Contrary to the belief that human rights are self-evident or even naturally given, the historical changeability and the wide scope for interpretation are indeed central to this phenomenon. The contemporary understanding of human rights is based on experiences of oppression; moral authority and insistence on universal validity are, after all, not based on declarative, abstract, and philosophical explanations, but on the practical promise of averting avoidable suffering and guaranteeing individual freedom.

        <h3> Medieval Social Media </h3>
        <p>
          My works in this topic explore the transformation of social life in the post-Roman world of the Mediterranean and surrounding regions from the fifth through to the eighth centuries. The political and social changes of this period had a lasting effect on the broad variety of social networks that defined the lives of individuals. These changes can be seen in the dominant social media of the time, letters, art, poetry, sermons, inscriptions, just to name a few.

        <h3> Rome after Rome </h3>
        <p>
          Rome was once the capital of a Mediterranean empire, one of the largest cities of the ancient world, with around a million inhabitants. But during the Middle Ages, Rome was a city of only tens of thousands. Yet it was home to one of medieval Europe&#39s most important institutions, the papacy. Its classical and Christian glories endured. And thus it still was an important center of political, religious, and economic innovation, and a goal for pilgrims, emperors, and factions.

        <h3> Impact of auditory stress </h3>
        <p>
          There are different kinds of stresses: eustress can contribute to special performance and concentration abilities while distress can lead to a long-term decline in performance and lack of attention. Especially acoustic stress is associated with negative stress. But how does this stress does this stress have on our creativity in the short term? In this online study, the stress level is to be increased by enervating music in order to observe an effect on the creativity of the participants by means of a modified creativity test.

        <h3> History of Political Thought </h3>
        <p>
          Here, an overview of the history of political thought from antiquity to modern times was created. Political theory is treated and contextualized from a historical perspective in its diachronic development. The project follows both a chronological and a thematic approach for the discussion of its development and evolution. Special attention was given to political thought in Ancient Greece, in the Islamic World, in Western modernity, and in the context of economics.

          The exhibition space conceptualised in this work gives visitors an understanding of the connection between the topics of sport and gender through six large installations and three text elements. The questions: "What does sport have to do with gender?" and "What role do/did women play in the history of sports in Austria?" serve as a guiding thread and examine different approaches to answering these questions through multi-sensory and interactive expositions.

        <h3> Feminist Theories </h3>
        <p>
          Historical gender research deals with gendered people and understands 'gender' as an indispensable category for the historical analysis of human relationships. Many influential feminists of the 1970s argue that inequality is not based on gender differences, but on power relationships, whereas today another view prevales. Under the title gender, nothing other than women's history was often practiced and thus the demand to recognize 'women' and 'men' as discursive constructions, to deconstruct them and to understand gender as a metaphor for power relations, was not met.

        <h3> Tokyo Trials </h3>
        <p>
          The Allied war-crime courts in Asia and Europe were set up with the intention of bringing to justice those who had committed atrocities against military personnel and civilians. This task turned out to involve a complex network of rules and intentions, further complicated by the fact that economic, cultural and political realities of the invaded regions had a significant role. In this work I wanted to highlight and explain the context in which the British war crimes trials were performed, using the trials in Burma as a paradigmatic example.

        <h3> Economic History </h3>
        <p>
          Today the capitalist economy is an integral part of human coexistence, and difficult to question - on the one hand because of its ubiquitous presence and on the other because of its inherent contradictions. The question of what the economy actually is, or what constitutes it, was analysed in this work. Significant texts by the (economic) historians were consulted with regard to the character of economies, the connections between politics, society and the economy, and capitalism per se.

        <h3> Global History </h3>
        <p>
          A quote by Theodore H. Von Laue served as a springboard into further studies into various countries' histories, including China, Brazil, America and India (amongst others): “World history poses perhaps the biggest challenge for the present generation of academic historians. There is no dearth of available facts. What we need are proper (panhuman!) perspectives and an enlarged vision for organizing these facts in order to gain a clearer understanding of where we all have come from over human destiny."

        <h3> Carbon Capture and Storage </h3>
        <p>
          Carbon capture and storage is a process in which fossil CO2 emissions are captured from the atmosphere and transported and stored in special underground storage sites, preventing them from further engaging in the Greenhouse-effect. This potential panacea is at the center of current climate discussions. Considering questions of economic viability, storage sites, efficiency, and conflicts of interest my research paper provides an insight into the future-proofness of this technology.

        <h3> Material History </h3>
        <p>
          The aim of this historical enquiry is to educate people about materials. This can be achieved through a historical-narrative narrative in which, on the one hand, technical, religious, political, economic and cultural contexts of action and effect are shown and, on the other, the material is assigned its own 'active potential'. A central question is how conclusions can be drawn about collective identities or power relations. Some materials function as cultural symbols, their use being inherently context-dependent, even on a political level.
