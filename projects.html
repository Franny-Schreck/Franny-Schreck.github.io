          <h3> Comfort Women </h3>
          <p>
            In this work, a very specific form of gender-based violence was analyzed: the topic of systematic rape of women in times of war, which is still often neglected in research. In this work I tried to shed light on the cultural and colonial backgrounds of the Korean Comfort Women system emposed by the Japanese during World War II in order to understand the structure and justification of it.

        <h3> Global History </h3>
        <p>
          A quote by Theodore H. Von Laue served as a springboard into further studies into various countries' histories, including China, Brazil, America and India (amongst others): “World history poses perhaps the biggest challenge for the present generation of academic historians. There is no dearth of available facts. What we need are proper (panhuman!) perspectives and an enlarged vision for organizing these facts in order to gain a clearer understanding of where we all have come from over human destiny."

        <h3> Homosexuality in Nazi Germany </h3>
        <p>
          As a general rule, some events and perspectives receive more attention than others - which, however, can be detrimental to historiography. This is what I tried to show in this work, in which one of the most central and intensely investigated events of the 20th century is processed with the help of an unconventional source: Germany after Hitler came to power and the Holocaust using an intimate 'queer' notebook.

        <h3> Material History </h3>
        <p>
          The aim of this historical enquiry is to educate people about materials. This can be achieved through a historical-narrative narrative in which, on the one hand, technical, religious, political, economic and cultural contexts of action and effect are shown and, on the other, the material is assigned its own 'active potential'. A central question is how conclusions can be drawn about collective identities or power relations. Some materials function as cultural symbols, their use being inherently context-dependent, even on a political level.

        <h3> Exhibition Conception </h3>
        <p>
          The exhibition space conceptualised in this work gives visitors an understanding of the connection between the topics of sport and gender through six large installations and three text elements. The questions: "What does sport have to do with gender?" and "What role do/did women play in the history of sports in Austria?" serve as a guiding thread and examine different approaches to answering these questions through multi-sensory and interactive expositions.

        <h3> Feminist Theories </h3>
        <p>
          Historical gender research deals with gendered people and understands 'gender' as an indispensable category for the historical analysis of human relationships. Many influential feminists of the 1970s argue that inequality is not based on gender differences, but on power relationships, whereas today another view prevales. Under the title gender, nothing other than women's history was often practiced and thus the demand to recognize 'women' and 'men' as discursive constructions, to deconstruct them and to understand gender as a metaphor for power relations, was not met.

        <h3> Tokyo Trials </h3>
        <p>
          The Allied war-crime courts in Asia and Europe were set up with the intention of bringing to justice those who had committed atrocities against military personnel and civilians. This task turned out to involve a complex network of rules and intentions, further complicated by the fact that economic, cultural and political realities of the invaded regions had a significant role. In this work I wanted to highlight and explain the context in which the British war crimes trials were performed, using the trials in Burma as a paradigmatic example.

        <h3> Economic History </h3>
        <p>
          Today the capitalist economy is an integral part of human coexistence, and difficult to question - on the one hand because of its ubiquitous presence and on the other because of its inherent contradictions. The question of what the economy actually is, or what constitutes it, was analysed in this work. Significant texts by the (economic) historians were consulted with regard to the character of economies, the connections between politics, society and the economy, and capitalism per se.
