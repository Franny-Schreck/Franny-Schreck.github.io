    <h1 style="padding-top: 50; margin-top: 50pt; font-weight: bold; font-size: xx-large;" class="faded">Triceratops</h1>

    <h3 class="faded" style="text-align: center;">
        This is a collection of facts that I found interesting about this funky-looking dinosaur. While I was listening to the <a href="https://terriblelizards.libsyn.com/">Terrible Lizards Podcast</a> by Dr David Hone and Iszi Lawrence I found myself taking notes - this is the result of my further exploration of the topic.
    </h3>

    <br>

    <h2 class="faded" style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">Time and Place</h2>

    <p class="faded blog-text">
      Triceratops lived at the end of the Cretaceous period - the last few million years of the dinosaur era - in an area that is now North America (some have also been found in parts of Asia). Interestingly, it was sympatric with Tyrannosaurus Rex, meaning that they lived at the same time and the same place, something extremely rare and thus very exciting for dinosaur-enthusiasts. 
      <br>
      Being the biggest of the horned dinosaurs (a group called "Ceratopsians"), most specimens of Triceratops were bigger than those we generally see in museums: they were significantly larger than rhinoceroses, reaching more than 2 meters shoulder height. Pair this with the fact that their back legs were significantly longer than their front legs, and you've got a creature under whose belly you could comfortably stand upright. With great height comes great chonk, and unlike other huge dinosaurs, Triceratops did not have hollow bones to alleviate that weight.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2 class="faded" style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">Ancestors</h2>

    <p class="faded blog-text">
      Attentive readers may have raised an eyebrow during the last paragraph, since quadrupeds usually have longer front- than backlegs to keep their center of mass in front of their hind legs (consider for example the above-mentioned rhinoceroses). The ancestors of Triceratops were bipedal and their center of mass was above their hips, so that they could keep their balance while walking. This necessitated a shrinking of their front legs and a strengthening and enlarging of the hind ones. As often happend with dinosaurs, Triceratops evolved back into a quadrupedal locomotion, explaining their leg-size-situation. Given enough time, they would most likely have gotten to a more balanced stature.
      <br>
      The earliest Ceratopsians (such as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psittacosaurus">Psittacosaurus</a>) were small, bipedal dinosaurs that already had spiky cheeks, frills, as well as bristles along their tails. Most ceratopsians that evolved from this common ancestor developed hard frills, seen as a kind of neck-shield at the rear of the skull. Where Triceratops differs from its peers is while most neck frills had large holes to minimise their weight, its frill was made of solid bone.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2 class="faded" style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">Filament</h2>

    <p class="faded blog-text">
      Filaments are always a hotly debated topic concerning dinosaurs, and it's no different in this species. One fossil of a Ceratopsian has been found with conclusive evidence that it definetly had filament, which could imply that other Ceratopsians could have had it as well - but this has not been proven. From a theoretical standpoint, it is plausible that Triceratops could have had filament along its back, extending from large pointy scales that one specimen preserved with skin in Canada was shown to have had.
    </p>

    <br>
    
    <h2 class="faded" style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">Diet and Skeleton</h2>

    <p class="faded blog-text">
      Triceratops was fully herbivorous. This may seem counterintuitive at first but as we know from studying our current fauna: the larger the animal, the more efficient it is for them to eat and digest fibrous plant material.
      <br>
      This diet was enabled by a very large beak. Beaks have evolved in very different animals for various different reasons (an example of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convergent_evolution">convergent evolution</a>). It is generally just defined as the bony part in front of the face, and is usually made up of keratin - and is very useful for various applications.
      <br>
      One of the main distinguishing features of Triceratops are (surprisingly enough!) its teeth. They are V-shaped because of their two roots, which is not found in any other dinosaur or reptile and thus highly unusual. This means that even if only bone fragments are found but they include a two-rooted tooth, it is almost assuredly a Triceratops skeleton. It is not known why Triceratops did not live in Europe, since the climate would have been similar and the distance not very great - but there has only been a single Triceratopsian tooth found in the Balkans and not a fragment more.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2 class="faded" style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">Horns and Shield</h2>

    <p class="faded blog-text">
      We are now approaching the big question lingering in the room: What did Triceratops use its horns and frill for? There is a specimen whose brow horns bear teeth marks from Tyrannosaurus Rex, so they were certainly used for self defence - but not exclusively! The reasoning is that carnivores mostly hunt young animals: they are easier to catch and safer to overpower. These are vitally important aspects, since a wounded carnivore is (almost) already a dead carnivore. Furthermore, the hind legs are Triceratops' most vulnerable body part, especially when running away - and they are in no way especially protected.
      <br>
      The most plausibe theory to date explains that the horns were mainly for fighting with each other (in a way similar to antelopes and deer today). A study analysing the points of injury from fighting conspecifics (where they would hit and lock into each other) found significant overlap with the fossil record. This implies that the fights happened because of territorial control, and also explains why both genders equally exhibit the horns. A further argument pointing towards this conclusion is the fact that if the horns were critical for self-defence, young Triceratopsians would grow them very quickly, being predated more often - but this is not the case.
      <br>
      The shield probably evolved to defend against opponents' horns, since apart from Triceratops, most Ceratopsians' shields were hollow and thus not very effective when fighting off blood-thirsty predators.
    </p>

    <br>

    <h2 class="faded" style="text-align: left; font-weight: bold;">Solidarity</h2>

    <p class="faded blog-text">
      Some Ceratopsians lived in groups, known because some flash floods caused mass drownings - preserving whole herds in the fossilisation process. One incident is not enough to make this claim, but they have semi-regularly been found to have been trapped in groups, corroborating it.
      <br>
      Only groups of young Triceratops have been found and none of older specimens, implying that they became solidary when older (similar to deer today). Keeping this in mind, the theory of territorial fights becomes even more plausible.
