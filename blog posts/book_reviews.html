    <summary>Zorba the Greek - Nikos Kazantzakis</summary>
    
    <p style="font-size: 15px;">
      If you gloss over the misogyny and are ready to simply enjoy the reading experience, this really is a nice little life-affirming read. The Buddhist philosophy of ascetics which the "writer" is overly concerned with is contrasted with the kind of no regrets, living-in-the-moment lifestyle pursued by Zorba. Together they enjoy a summer of friendly togetherness, talking and dancing with the villagers - taking in the sights and atmosphere of the Greek seaside.

    <summary>Tanz der Teufel - Fiston Mwanza Mujila</summary>
    
    <p style="font-size: 15px;">
      Extremely interesting topic, but bland protagonists and random side-characters that disappear as soon as they are introduced. Since there is no clear story to begin with, it's hard to tell where the author digresses and what he actually meant to say.

    <summary>Wölfe - Hilary Mantel</summary>
    
    <p style="font-size: 15px;">
      A quite underwhelming book - really a missed opportunity considering the vast cast of interesting characters and the tumultuous time in which it is set and situation that it deals with. The language and protagonist(s) remain respectively dull and confusing throughout the novel, and the fact that in the German edition the family trees and character overview are hidden somewhere in the last 10th of the book in a strange position that is not easily found (but a true life-saver) is a questionable editorial choice. The author tends to introduce new characters with a single name (e.g. duke of Norfolk) only to refer to the same person a sentence later with another name (e.g. Mr Howard) simply to give them yet another name in a chapter's time (e.g. Anne's uncle / Thomas): all the names mentioned are variations used to reference a single character. <br>

      It certainly gives the reader a rather thorough impression of the times, but one certainly wishes that themes, ideas and allusions were elaborated on further. Even given the hefty volume of the book, it feels both a little shallow and full of missed opportunities; while at the same time lenghty inflated sections could be cut away easily. The fact that the language used is not very impressive on its own, one rather wished for the content to make up for this. I feel that the tone and style used for the first two or three chapters could have easily been carried on through the book and made for a more interesting and immersive read. <br>

      It was disconcerting to see elements of modern drama appear in this historical account - not per se outlandish since people always have similar problems and interpersonal troubles - but in this case it felt like the author wanted to cover up a lack of ideas and find an easy / fast solution for a narrative cul-de-sac.

    <summary>Luster - Raven Leilani</summary>
    
    <p style="font-size: 15px;">
      This book is painful to read. None of the characters are likable and their actions both questionable in the worst possible way and unreasonable in their cruely. But still: The beauty of the prose and the personality analyses that are subtly woven through the novel mean that each characters' flaws and their (often deliberately) vicious behaviour do not feel forced but a necessary implication of their being in each other's proximity. It is not often that I linger for a long time on a sentence of paragraph so gracefully constructed that it inspires awe and simply deserves multiple re-reads. Some situations are comical and genuinely funny in their plausible strangeness. <br>

      This is also the first book that really brought the American issue with race and the possibly explosive ubiquitous tension that pervades all spaces - private and public alike - closer to my understanding. I still do not presume to know the everyday reality, but the unflinching portrait of the lives caught in the middle of this conflict - as harrowing as it is shown in this novel - truly made a difference in my viewing of the world. This is not something I say lightly. <br>

      The actual story of the book was the thing that put me off reading it for a long time, since it's not something I usually enjoy reading and that generally simply leaves a sour taste in my mouth without me gaining anything. But I didn't feel as though that was the actual story being told - the important stuff was in between the lines, next to the storyline: the characters' struggles, their aspirations, hopes, failures, interdependency, destructiveness. <br>

      I'm not sure if I would like to recommend this book to anyone, since I believe that it has to be appreciated in a certain way so as to not make it feel too raunchy, but still keep its heartwrenching honesty.

    <summary>Bluets - Maggie Nelson</summary>
    
    <p style="font-size: 15px;">
      The author wants to emulate the style of Clarice Lispector, but sadly utterly fails at this. Neither the overall story (a failed love and the protagonist's coming to term with this) nor the half-baked underdeveloped philosophical ideas can save this book, even though the premise is a fascinating one. The actual colour blue does not really play a prominent role, although the parts where it does are the only worthwhile ones - as well as recapitulations of other thinkers' attempts at grasping the essence and meaning of "colour". Overall, this mostly feels like the author took her favourite diary entry snippets and bits of Wikipedia-found blue-trivia and combined them into this forgettable conglomeration.

    <summary>As I Lay Dying - William Faulkner</summary>
    
    <p style="font-size: 15px;">
      Definetly worth a re-read; it's too filled with references and subtle allusions to be understood the first time round. The writing style (the adaptation of southern slang/dialect) often makes it difficult to follow without reading aloud. Fascinating story (after the rather slow start in the first third of the book) and great execution, overall many ideas that will require a thoughtful revisitation to be fully appreciated.

    <summary>Out - Natsuo Kirino</summary>
    
    <p style="font-size: 15px;">
      This crime-mystery novel is as brutal and hard-edged as anything I've ever read. Kirino takes her story to the very edge, then unflinchingly goes over it. I think, more than anything, I appreciated Kirino's steady tune throughout the book, and her ability to take seemingly disparate strands of stories and characters and tie them together in ways that make sense. She plumbs the depths of all her characters, both their strenghts and their weaknesses, and what emerges is a compelling portrait of friendships tested and loyalties questioned. Her characters quickly become real people and she portrays them with compassion, but also with a pragmatist's careful eye. All told, its a book that travels between the Dark and the Thought-provoking... excellent!

    <summary>A Night of Blacker Darkness - Fredrick Whithers</summary>
    
    <p style="font-size: 15px;">
      Set in the regency period, this tale is witty, fast-paced and a bit macabre. It's a fast and enjoyable read with smart humor, quick dialogue, and many VERY odd situations: It has a slapstick with a dark feel to it. Overall a great story, which, while being a bit ridiculous, manages to be extremely hilarious.

    <summary>The Brief and Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao - Junot Díaz</summary>
    
    <p style="font-size: 15px;">
      Energetic and imaginative writing combined with convincingly flawed, interesting and memorable characters. The story examines how rationality, culture, and language become more and more blended over generations. The overall effect of the book is a great deal more sad, tragic, pathetic and depressing than I had expected. All in all a good novel on the fulfillment of family patterns and the weight of history.

    <summary>The Terrors of Ice and Darkness - Christoph Ransmayr</summary>
    
    <p style="font-size: 15px;">
      A masterwork of its genre: a studious piece of non-fiction and always beyond the bounds of the ordinary - an ultimately extraordinary explorer novel with intrepid adventurers experiencing the most daunting terrors.

    <summary>The Name of the Rose - Umberto Eco</summary>
    
    <p style="font-size: 15px;">
      Very descriptive narrative with several layers to it - a historical look at the politics and machinations of the Church and the State. It's just a wonderfully crafted story, the style both smooth and captivating. The clever and meticulous intricacies of the plot unravel at a perfect pace before you.

    <summary>Atonement - Ian McEwan</summary>
    
    <p style="font-size: 15px;">
      A very shallow book with a complete absence of any narrative drive. McEwan belies he can write hundreds of pages where very little happens, where the writing is exceptional only in its ordinariness and tediousness, where he says nothing of any significance.

    <summary>Der Besuch der alten Dame - Friedrich Dürrenmatt</summary>
    
    <p style="font-size: 15px;">
      Astonishing play about the perilious effects of materialism. It's funny, sad, original and enjoyable. Claire is a fantastically strong character and Ill's destitute neighbours are predictably mercenary. It explores the power of consumerism and industry while also looking at the more stardard themes of love and betrayal. This play shows humanity's fundamental hypocrisy (not only for money, but for justice) and our stigma toward corruption which we try to cover up by "legitimate" means.

    <summary>The Essential Ginsberg - Allen Ginsberg</summary>
    
    <p style="font-size: 15px;">
      I liked some of Ginsberg's poems, but none of his other writing - especially in his essays (and some of his letters) one cannot help but feel one is reading an overrated drug-fuelled eccentric who sees himself as a modern Jesus. One little touch that I did however enjoy in this issue were the photographs at the end, as they put faces to the names that appear all over the book.

    <summary>The Spy Who Came In from the Cold - John le Carré</summary>
    
    <p style="font-size: 15px;">
      Le Carré gives the reader no enemy, no "bad guy", to draw a moral compass from; as in real life (and especially in the Cold War) there are only people on both sides faithfully following their principles and methods, doing what it seems has to be done, and realising too late that the results are terrible. The awful situations created and choices made are presented as a problem, a battle in which human lives are sacrificed and traded and nothing of proportional value is recovered by anyone. As in Orwell's 1984, human suffering is demanded by calculating systems of control and nobody has the power to stop it.

    <summary>Verteidigung der Missionarsstellung - Wolf Haas</summary>
    
    <p style="font-size: 15px;">
      Although the story is told in a very multifaceted way, there is no actual "plot". It is not only difficult to classify this novel regarding its content: The author's typography shows that it's indeed the play with his readers' sense through the novel's very form. It may be that he repeats a paragraph in a visually appealing and non-sensical manner until it becomes illegible or even written entirely in Chinese. However, this experiment ultimately falls short spectacularly.
