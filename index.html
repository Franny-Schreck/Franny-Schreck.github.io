        <p id="introduction"  data-aos="fade-up"> My name is Fanny Schreck and I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in environmental engineering at the Vienna University of Technology and my master's in history at the University of Vienna. Since this is only one of my interests, I am currently also dabbling in a few other areas, such as computer science (web design, typesetting systems and data compression) and learning / teaching practice research.<br>

        But I also enjoy furthering my knowledge through conversation and discussion, one of my reasons for launching a debate club in my school and now enrolling in my university's international legal study programme. I have found that regularly reading challenging texts and writing papers on topics of interest to me to be an involving way to dive deeper into them and consolidate my understanding. I don't think there is a lot to be gained by dwelling only on theory if you never put it into practice. I probably owe my personal approach to learning to my weakness for books - even today you hardly see me without one and I still often like to devour one in a single afternoon...</p>

        <h3>Written</h3>
        <p>During my pursuit of the history bachelor's degree I have had the opportunity to create many works concerning a multitude of different topics, themes and historical periods. Some papers I have written out of the simple want to gain a deeper theoretical understanding or just trying out some new methods. Global history </p>

        <h3>Speaking &amp; Roles </h3>
        <p>Having completed the International Baccalaureate (IB) with exceptionally high points, I was invited to local IB schools and preparatory tutoring institutions to give talks about my personal experience and share study-tips. Because these organisations are highly internationally oriented, my periodic talks and the subsequent discussions enabled me to </p>

        <h3>Tutoring</h3>
        <p>Giving talks in various IB-institutions enabled me to connect to many teachers and students. If needed, I would then give tutoring lessons in those subject that I graduated in - although mathematics, german and history were the most requested. After being exposed to many different students, I could experiment first-hand with teaching strategies and forms of explanation. This prompted to do more research into thoses. </p>
