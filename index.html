        <p> My name is Fanny Schreck and I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree in history at the University of Vienna. Since this is only one of my interests, I am currently also dabbling in a few other areas, such as computer science (web design, typesetting systems and data compression) and learning / teaching practice research.<br>

        But I also enjoy furthering my knowledge through conversation and discussion, one of my reasons for launching a debate club in my school and now enrolling in my university's international legal study programme. I have found that regularly reading challenging texts and writing papers on topics of interest to me to be an involving way to dive deeper into them and consolidate my understanding. I don't think there is a lot to be gained by dwelling only on theory if you never put it into practice. I probably owe my personal approach to learning to my weakness for books - even today you hardly see me without one and I still often like to devour one in a single afternoon..</p>
